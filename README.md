# Summary

Turkish version of the Penn Treebank. It consists of a total of 9,560 manually annotated sentences and 87,367 tokens. (It only includes sentences up to 15 words long.)


# Introduction

This treebank includes a total of 9,560  annotated sentences. We used the corpus of the Penn Treebank by translating its sentences into Turkish language. In our corpus, we kept the sentence length at 15 words long. After the translation, the word tokens are morphologically annotated with a semi-automatic morphological analyzer. The dependency annotation is made manually.
During the dependency annotation, annotators were able to see the original sentences from the Penn Treebank, therefore, they could check and correct the sentences according to the original data.
